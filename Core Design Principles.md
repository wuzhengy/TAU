* DAG - directed acyclic graph: every data item in TAU has both `content` and `link`. TAU content network can be viewed as a DAG. Any data connects another data for blocks, messages or images. 
  * Mutable item `content` is a pointer to a DAG node,the key of an immutable item; and link is another public key. 
   - The public key with a salt can form a new pointer. The new pointer nature is much dependent on channels. 
     - For #blk channle, it is another miner. 
     - For #msg, it is a latest message sending address. This pointer is used to make searching more efficient by every peers contributing knowledge.
  * Immutable item is a DAG node. The item `content` is the part of data schema, and `link` is pointing to another immutable item. Each immutable item also include a skip list pointer such as in block structure to point into a history item for speed up searching. 
* Data Schema - every mutable item's content is the root of a `data schema` or the first immutable item starting the schema.
  - Schema is series of immutable item together to present a data structure. IPLD protocol has built example of data schema.

* P2C - Peer to Consensus: every communication is under scope of a chain, which is a type of consensus. This is called `peer to consensus`.The consensus will regulate spam and make content searching efficient within limited nodes.
