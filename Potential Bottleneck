* May not fit for video streaming, which requires instant response of sources. 
* May not fit for voice conference or video conference. 
* May not fit for sub-second response required services such as autonomouse driving
* Incur multiple of data transmission: for each data item put and get, the dht will make recursive query to find remote peers for data exchange, it is estimate that each data item will need 10 steps to settle, which means 10 times data required for transmission one data item which is 1K. We assume future data cost will be dramtically lower and network speed will be faster.
