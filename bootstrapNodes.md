# TAU will initially simulate 1000 mobile devices on AWS global network to bootstrap the TAU messenger network. 
The nodes will allow each data item up to 100K. 
We will use docker system to deploy an initial DHT network over AWS. This does not violate server-less principle, it is a simulation of mobile phones on server for initial launching. Once we have enough real phones connected, we will reduce the AWS deployment.
