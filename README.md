### TAU App - Create crypto coins and trade community for free.
TAU helps you to create P2P crypto trade community independant from central servers. You can issue genuine blockchain coins free from third party transaction fee. TAU do not require users to buy any TAUcoins for enjoying full functions, so that community leaders can airdrop coins to participants freely.

We want to help individuals from everywhere to build crypto community and increase value of community coins; therefore TAU makes the full blockchain node system working on smart phones with low data consumption, which is important for developing regions such as Africa.

### About the core technologies
#### Perishable Proof of Transactions(PPOT) Blockchain Consensus Tailored for individual phones
TAU discovered the PPOT blockchain concensus, the more transactions history made, the higher mining power a node has. Without intensive puzzel solving competition such as in bitcoin, PPOT is a light weight consensus.

The perishable ledger will forget any block and state 6 months older, to make full blockchain size under 50Mbytes. Unlike immutable blockchains such as ethereum and bitcoin designed for long term financial contracts, PPOT is light for day to day commuinciation oriented apps. PPOT blocks are designed to register user, essential wiring and high capacity communication. The forgotten history is still hash-linked, so that fans or commercial entities can provide archive to store that, not cause burden for current mining nodes. 

PPOT enables a smart phone to hold and mine 100+ full blockchains. Collectively, the parallel blockchains bring to the ecosystem unlimted transaction capacity. TAU Cambridge provides an opensource C++ reference implementation of PPOT parallel mining and messaging on github.

#### Internet Protocol 2 - IP2
Internet Protocol 2(IP2) enables user to choose self-generated 256-bits "public key" as address, while classical Internet Protocol(IP1) appoints hierarchically and often dynamically addresses. IP1 has caused "uncertain device reachability" in type of addresses and connections, especially when same device is moving through different networks or locating in unknown firewall filtering rules; therefore additional proxy or name server infrastructure burden is needed for each application.

IP2 is designed for "public key direct to public key" overlay communication. Thanks to the innovation of XOR distance to form up the local capture swarm network, the nodes are incentivated to share "public key to IP address" naming and relaying for restricted nodes, disregard of application types.

On top of IP2, traditional TCP or UDP type of services could be rebuilt without worrying about static/dynamic, v4/v6, local/public, wifi/cellular types of IP1 addresses, as well as their dynamic address translation and filtering restrictions. This potentially reduces cost of operating IOT devices.

The technology stack includes "distributed routing and capture vectors", ED25519 assymetric encryption for premission-less and colision-free unique addressing, and pattern randomized transmission on UDP. TAU Cambridge provides an opensource C++ reference implementation libIP2 on github.

PPOT blockchain consensus and messaging are applications of IP2.
