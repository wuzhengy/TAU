Nutshell: similar to smart contract creating tokens, TAU each community blockchain can define own operation logic, such as in a new chain, you can define third variable to be the sum of all transaction volume or even adding interests. 
Some smart contract lanuage can be used to create such type of coin. Once a smart coin created, it can not be changed, if upgrade happens, it will be a new community chain.
