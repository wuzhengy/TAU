Nutshell: similar to smart contract creating tokens, TAU each community blockchain can define own operation logic, such as in a new chain, you can define third variable to be the sum of all transaction volume or even adding interests. 
Some smart contract lanuage can be used to create such type of coin. Once a smart coin created, it can not be changed, if upgrade happens, it will be a new community chain.

Smart coin and **stateful** <br>
When TAU added smart coin code, it means we will go stateful mining and validating. 
Each node will need entire blockchain ledger and state to function. This is why we design each of our block is 1K and 5 minutes one block generation speed. With smart coin, one can expanding address space faster than fixed logic. 

TAU coin multiple address wire <br>
We will add sending to multiple address to help increase the account space in a public ledger. In TAU, each block will allow to send up to 24 addresses.
