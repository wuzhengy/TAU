Lead by co-founder of Nasdaq listed internet company, TAU Cambridge is building world first "server-less" messenger, that aims to decentralize WhatsApp or WeChat. TAU will bring crypto coins economy into groups and transform a digital community into a rewarding commonwealth, which will incentivize loyal participation and quality of content contribution. 
The "server-less" technology stack will enable members to operate purely on mobile phones without paying for hosting cost and knowledge of IT infrastructure. It also means immutable and unblock-able communication among participants. 
By removing servers, TAU will demonstrate a new digital application ability without being over-taxed on information centralization and by controlling "big-tech" middlemen. 
TAU is at the stage of launching first MVP in 4Q 2020 and currently funded by angel investors and the founder. 
We operate our product development in pure open source on GitHub through global coding effort.
