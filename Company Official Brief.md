Lead by co-founder of Nasdaq listed internet company, TAU Cambridge is building world first "server-less" messenger, that aims to bring full freedom of information. Along with immutable and uncensorable communication, TAU brings crypto coins economy into groups and transforms a digital community into a commonwealth, which will incentivize loyal participation and quality of content contribution.  <br>
The "server-less" technology stack will enable members to operate purely on mobile phones without paying for hosting cost and knowledge of IT infrastructure. It also means immutable and unblock-able communication among participants. <br>
By removing servers, TAU will demonstrate a new digital application ability without being controlled or taxed by "big-techs". <br>
TAU is at the stage of launching first MVP in 4Q 2020 and currently funded by angel investors and the founder. <br>
We operate our product development in pure open source on GitHub through global coding effort. 
TAUcoin community will provide software to support server-less protocol and eventually become a global news chain.
