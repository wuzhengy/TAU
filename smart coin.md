* one year stateful
TAU blockchain will only recogonize one year on chain state, any state beyond will be forgotten forever. this will make one blockchain in flat size forever, good for phones. you can also view one year stateful is **epoch stateful mining** and **full stateless verification**. 

simple opcodes: 1 to n wiring

TAU coin multiple address wire <br>
We will add sending to multiple address to help increase the account space in a public ledger. In TAU, each block will allow to send up to 24 addresses. 

* define variables: integer, list, string
* define address-nonce pair

hash the smart contract into chain id. 

Class blockchain_main_loop{

Class state{
