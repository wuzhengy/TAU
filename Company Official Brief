TAU will bring crypto coins economy into groups and transform a digital community into a commonwealth, which will incentivate loyal participation and quality of content. 
The "server-less" technology stack will enable folks to operate purely on mobile phones without paying for server cost and knowledge to run a IT infrastructure. It also means immutable and unblock-able communication. 
By removing servers, TAU will demonstrate a new digital application ability without being over-taxed on information centralization and controlling "big-tech" middlemen to over. 
TAU is at the stage of launching first MVP in 4Q 2020 and currently funded by angel investors and the founder.
