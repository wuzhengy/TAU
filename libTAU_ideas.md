### Phone Crypto Mining basic process
Adopt the right fork
    * post to immutable point, highest difficulty dorminates
         * Seeking immutable point from mutable blockchain signal (know peers + chain ID),(block hash, ip+port, immutable point hash)
    * prior to immutable point, need 10% or 100 of random nodes to agree
         * if 10% or 100 nodes immutable point prior to current immutable point, then enter a voting
