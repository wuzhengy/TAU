TAU Cambridge(UK) is a R&D company on server-less communication protocol, that enables phones to communicate without being connected to hosts. Today, phones connect to each others through cloud services for media, messaging and commerce. Without relying on servers, resources will not be over-concentrated, and community will not be over-charged by “big techs”. 

To prove server-less technology, we are building a free android app, “TAU Coins Community”, enabling phones to form up many independent blockchain systems for coins circulation and messaging, so that people can operate payment and finance business with community support.

We develop our technology using Java Android and C++ with 100% source open. The only cost for user is the data transmission. We pay particular attention to save data consumption and tailor it to be useful in slow and expensive data region such as Africa and ASEAN.
