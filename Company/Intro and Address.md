TAU Cambridge(UK) is a R&D company on server-less communication protocol, that enables  phones to communicate without being connected to hosts. Today, phones connect to each others through cloud services for media, messaging and commerce. Without relying on servers, resources will not be over-concentrated, and community will not be over-charged by "big techs" on a variety of apps. 

To demonstrate server-less technology, we are building a free android app to enable personal phone to create an independent blockchain system to support coins circulation and messaging, so that they can operate payment and fund business with community support.

We develop our technology using Java Android and C++ with 100% source open. The only cost for user is the data transmission. We pay particular attention to save data consumption and tailor it to be useful in slow and expensive data region such as Africa and ASEAN.
