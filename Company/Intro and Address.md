TAU Cambridge(UK) is building an android app, “TAU Coins Community”, enabling phones to form up server-less independent blockchains for coins circulation and peers messaging, so that individuals can operate payment and finance business within community.

We develop our technology using Java Android and C++ with 100% source open. The only cost for user is the data transmission. We pay particular attention to save data consumption and tailor it to be useful in slow and expensive data region such as Africa and ASEAN.
