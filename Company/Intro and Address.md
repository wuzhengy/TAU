TAU Cambridge(UK) focuses on R&D of mobile device server-less communication protocol, which enables smart phones to communicate without connected to hosts. Today, phones connect to each others through cloud services for social media, instant messaging and ecommerce. <br>

On top of server-less technology, we are building an android app to enable individual phone to create a full blockchain system to support community coins circulation and messaging, so that they can operate the payment and fund business ideas with the community support. <br>

We develop our technology using Java Android and C++ with 100% source open. The only cost for user is the data transmission. We pay particular attention to network data consumption and tailor it to be useful in slow and expensive data region such as Africa and ASEAN.
