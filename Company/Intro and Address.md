TAU Cambridge(UK) is building an android app, “TAU Coins Community". 
It enables phones to form up independent blockchains for coins circulation and peers messaging without server, so that individuals can operate payment and finance business in a community.

In the core, we develop a server-less communication protocol with Java and C++ source open. The only cost for user is the data transmission. We pay particular attention to save data consumption and tailor it to be useful in expensive data region such as Africa and ASEAN.
