### TAU Coins Community - funding your business
Naa’s dream is to set up a shop to produce and sell garlic paste. Like many women in Ghana, she needs money to buy the raw materials. She is surrounded by a community that could support her. She has one android phone and does not plan to pay any cloud services.

TAU is a free app that can enable Naa to generate blockchain coins, which she can then exchange with her community in return for Ghanaian Cedis, so she is able to buy raw materials and produce the paste. The coins can then be used by her community to buy the garlic paste from Naa at a competitive price.

As the community demand grows and the volume of transactions increases, the value of the coins increase against the Cedis, because of the quantity of coins is limitted mathematically. It’s a ‘win-win’ for Naa and her customers.
