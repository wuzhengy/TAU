### TAU - pay and sell digital coins
Anna’s dream is to make and sell garlic paste in Accra. She needs money to buy the raw materials. Anna is surrounded by a customer community that like her products. She has only one android phone and want to raise the money and process payment.

TAU is a free app that can enable Anna to generate digital coins, which she can exchange with customers in return for Ghanaian Cedis cash. The coins can then be used by customers to buy the garlic paste at a lower price.

As the business grows, the value of the coins increase against the Cedis, because of the quantity of coins is limitted while cash always depreciating. It’s a ‘win-win’ for Anna and her customers.
