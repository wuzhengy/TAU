### TAU - decentral coins messenger
Anna, a lovely Ghana village lady, dreams to start a shop to serve delicious garlic paste. She does not have 500 dollars of Cedis to buy garlic, while neighbours know that Anna will make good paste with heart. <br>
TAU provides a 100% free phone app for Anna to raise money, chat with community and promote products. Without computer expertise, Ann will use TAU in one "touch" to make 10 thousands blockchain coins and exchange some coins for Ghana Cedis from customers to buy garlic and other ingredients. Customers can later use Anna's coins to buy garlic paste on nice discount. <br>
Anna got 500 dollars with no interest, and customers get garlic paste on nice price and hold coins for future use. No one pays expensive IT service fee forever. <br>
To achieve these, TAU engineers combine the world most advanced blockchain, torrent and mobile technologies to create a open-source software to make following technology advancements:<br>
* server-less: no money required to operate the infrastruture forever, everything is on the phone swarm network
* blockchain coins circulation: non-inflation, transparent and immutable
* supporting global millions of community with unlimited capacity
