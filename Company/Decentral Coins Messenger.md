### TAU - decentral coins messenger
Anna, a lovely Ghanaian rural lady, dreams of setting up a shop to produce and serve delicious garlic paste. But she needs 500 dollars of Cedis to buy the raw materials, even though friends and neighbours are aware that Anna will make good paste and is dedicated. <br>
TAU provides a pure free phone app for Anna to raise money, chat with community and promote the products. Without computer expertise, Anna will use the app to generate 10,000 digital coins and exchange some coins for Cedis to buy the raw materials. Customers can use Anna's blockchain coins to purchase the products at a very nice discount. <br>
The coins serve as credit where customers can use these to buy products. This gives Anna access to cash. The transaction puts value onto coins. 
Anna gets 500 dollars and has not incurred any interest, and her customers also get garlic paste at a competetive price. In addition, Anna's customers who hold the coins, are gaining additional coins which are generarted by transactions taking place in the community. No one ever pays banking service or website hosting costs. Everyone is happy. <br>
