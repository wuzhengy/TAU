### TAU - decentral coins messenger
Anna, a lovely Ghanaian rural lady, dreams of setting up a shop to produce and serve delicious garlic paste. But she does not have 500 dollars of cedis to buy the raw materials, even though friends and neighbours are aware that Anna will make good paste and is dedicated. <br>
TAU provides a pure free phone app for Anna to raise money, chat with community and promote the products. Without computer expertise, Ann will use TAU to make 10 thousands blockchain coins and exchange some coins for initial Cedis to buy the raw materials. Customers can use Anna's blockchain coins to purchase the products at a very nice discount. <br>
Anna gets 500 dollars with no interest, and her customers also get garlic paste on a good price and as well as gain coins for future use. No one pays expensive IT service fee forever. Everyone happy. <br>
To achieve these, TAU engineers combine the world most advanced blockchain, torrent and mobile technologies to create a 100% open-source software to make following technology advancements:
* server-less: no money required to operate the infrastructure forever, everything is on the phone swarm network
* blockchain coins circulation: non-inflation, transparent and immutable
* supporting global millions of community with unlimted capacity
