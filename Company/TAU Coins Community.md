### TAU Coins Community - funding your business
Anna’s dream is to set up a shop to produce and sell garlic paste. Like many women in Ghana, she needs money to buy the raw materials. She is surrounded by a community that could support her. She has one android phone and does not plan to pay any IT services.

TAU is a free app that can enable Anna to generate secure digital coins, which she can exchange with her community in return for Ghanaian Cedis, so she is able to buy raw materials and produce the paste. The coins can then be used by her community to buy the garlic paste at a lower price.

As the business grows, the value of the coins increase against the Cedis, because of the quantity of coins is limitted while Cedis always depreciating. It’s a ‘win-win’ for Anna and her customers.

This is Anna from Ghana.
She dreams of having her own shop selling garlic paste. 
To start her business she needs 1000 US Dollars worth of Cedis.
Anna knows that neither the bank nor anyone else will give her a reasonable loan.

However, she finds out about an app that will help her to raise funds: 
TAU - a digital coin solution for funding and payment.
She downloads it to her smartphone and creates her own highly secure blockchain coins. 
One coin equals one jar of garlic paste. 
She can now sell the coins to her customers in exchange for cash. 
Customers can later use Anna's coin for garlic paste.
Easy! Anna gets funding, and customers get nice price.
