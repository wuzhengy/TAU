### TAU Coins Community - funding your business
Anna’s dream is to set up a shop to produce and sell garlic paste in Accra. She needs money to buy the raw materials. Anna is surrounded by a community that could support her. She has one android phone and want to raise the money and process payment.

TAU is a free app that can enable Anna to generate secure digital coins, which she can exchange with her community in return for Ghanaian Cedis, so she is able to buy raw materials. The coins can then be used by her community to buy the garlic paste at a lower price.

As the business grows, the value of the coins increase against the Cedis, because of the quantity of coins is limitted while Cedis always depreciating. It’s a ‘win-win’ for Anna and her customers.
