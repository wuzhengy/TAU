### TAU Coins Community - funding your business
Anna’s dream is to set up a shop to produce and sell garlic paste. Like many women in Ghana, she needs money to buy the raw materials. She is surrounded by a community that could support her. She has one android phone and does not plan to pay any IT services.

TAU is a free app that can enable Anna to generate secure digital coins, which she can exchange with her community in return for Ghanaian Cedis, so she is able to buy raw materials and produce the paste. The coins can then be used by her community to buy the garlic paste at a lower price.

As the business grows, the value of the coins increase against the Cedis, because of the quantity of coins is limitted while Cedis always depreciating. It’s a ‘win-win’ for Anna and her customers.

This is Anna from Ghana.

She dreams of having her own shop selling garlic paste. 

To start her business she needs 500 US Dollars.

Anna knows that neither the bank nor anyone else will give her a loan.

However, she finds out about an app that will enable her to raise funds: 

the TAU Coins Community - a digital coin solution for getting funds.

She downloads it to her smartphone and creates her own coins. 

One coin equals one jar of garlic paste. 

Easy!

She can now sell her coins to her potential customers in exchange for cash, who can later redeem them for garlic paste.
