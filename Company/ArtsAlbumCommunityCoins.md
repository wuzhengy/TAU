### Discover value for songs with the fans
In a social network dominated world, community is the source of power and wealth. 
A big idea is to transfer the ownership of song/album to coins community, than middle companies. Any address owning 1 coin can use the song for any commercial purpose.
#### Problems
* Value discovery of a song is controlled
* NFT deployment requires transaction fees paying to third party chains, such as eth or bnb, for every on-chain activities. It will be a significant cost burden for fans. 
* The community message service are too costly or not available on main stream blockchain public ledger. 
#### Potential solutions
* Each song or Album is an independant blockchain with native coins, vs tokens. 
* Fans maintain the mainnet using phone to form up swarms without cost of deploy servers. 
* Communication is done over perishable proof of transaction consensus.
