### Introduction
#### TAU App - Freely Operate Ads Coin

By free airdrop of crypto coins to group members, a coin community is created. Coins holders can make money by selling coins to any marketeer for showing Ads. 

TAU is a serverless blockchain tech without using dedicated host, while everything is on phones network.

We do not require you to buy any TAUcoins. We are FREE and open source.

#### Crypto Airdrop Toolset
* No third party charge such as ETH gas.
* Send and airdrop coins to contacts.
* Not tieing to any dedicate servers. 

### About the core technologies
#### Perishable Proof of Transactions(PPOT) Blockchain Consensus Tailored for individual phones

TAU discovered the PPOT blockchain concensus, that is the more transactions history made, the higher mining power a node has. Without intensive puzzle solving competition such as in bitcoin, PPOT is a light weight consensus in terms of electricty and computing power. 

The **perishable** ledger will expire blocks beyond 6 months older, to make full blockchain size under 50 Mbytes. Unlike immutable blockchains such as ethereum and bitcoin designed for long term financial contracts, PPOT is for commuinciation oriented apps. **PPOT blocks are planned to register users, essential wiring and unlimited communication capacity**. The expired blocks have linked-hash to ensure the data integrity and could be optionally archived by anyone interested, which reduces the burden of active mining nodes.

PPOT enables a smart phone to hold and mine 100+ full blockchains. Collectively, the parallel blockchains bring to the ecosystem unlimted and unrestricted communication ability. 
TAU Cambridge provides libTAU, an opensource C++ reference implementation of PPOT parallel mining and messaging on [github](https://github.com/Tau-Coin/libTAU).

#### Internet Protocol 2 - IP2

Internet Protocol 2(IP2) enables user to choose self-generated 256-bits "public key" as immutable address, while classical Internet Protocol(IP1) appoints hierarchical and often dynamical addresses. IP1 has caused "uncertain device reachability", especially when same device is moving through different networks or locating in unknown firewall filtering rules; therefore, additional proxy or name server infrastructure cost is needed for each application.

IP2 is designed for "public key direct to public key" overlay communication. Thanks to the innovation of XOR distance to form up the local capture swarm network, the nodes are incentivated to join "public key to IP address" naming and relaying for enhancing own connectivity.

On top of IP2, traditional TCP or UDP type of services could be rebuilt without worrying about static/dynamic, v4/v6, local/public, wifi/cellular types of IP1 addresses, as well as their dynamic address translation and filtering restrictions. Due to self-addressing, each public key can be used by unlimited multiple devices. The traditional concept of definitive sequencial data stream need to be modified to use "probabilistic data structure" such as levenstain distance list of hash. This potentially reduces cost of operating IOT devices. 

The technology stack includes "distributed routing and capture swarm vectors", ED25519 assymetric encryption for premission-less and colision-free unique addressing, and pattern randomized transmission on UDP. TAU Cambridge provides an opensource C++ reference implementation libIP2 on [github](https://github.com/Tau-Coin/IP2).

PPOT blockchain consensus and messaging are applications of IP2.
