### Introduction
#### TAU - create your trade community on crypto
TAU mobile app enables you to create crypto trade community with own native coin independantly from servers. We emphasize saving mobile data, so that P2P trade can operate in every corner of the world. We do not require user to own TAUcoins for enjoying all the functions.

### libTAU

* We provide free and open source libTAU for developers to use our tech stack to build decentralized application without server deployments. 
TAU Cambridge is creating an open-source peer to peer communication network using blockchain technologies. Without tieing to servers, phones will be able to build and trade coins independently.
When phones can communicate to each other for free and, at the same time, be incentivated financially through blockchain coins, it reduces IT cost of operating an application and removes middleman charge. It will allow transparent and permission-less application data exchange.
A open source c++ library for server-less p2p and blockchain communication with Java Swig and Shell interface. libTAU is forked out of libtorrent by answering following key problems, which were unsolvable in the pre-blockchain world. 
* Incentive to provide data, bandwidth and cpu power for peers
* Avoid Internet router protocol screening
* Pre-arranged bootstrap and time server 
<br> <br>

We also address server based blockchain problems. 
* Secret chain attack in the POS world
* Ledger data supply incentive
* Stateful to stateless transition for a flat state storage
* One phone mines 100 parallel independent blockchains

### About the core technology
TAU discovered the Perishable Proof of Transactions(PPOT) blockchain concensus, the more transactions made, the higher mining power it is. Without intensive puzzel solving competition, PPOT is a light weight blockchain consensus. The **perishable** ledger will forget any blocks 6 months older, to make full node size under 50M. Unlike immutable blockchain such as ethereum and bitcoin designed for long term financial contracts, PPOT is for day to day application communication on decentralized blockchain. <br><br> Dynamic TPS (Transactions per second) allows instant transaction on chain if sender is willing to pay more fee. <br> 
One average smart phone mines 100+ full blockchains, based on libTAU server-less blockchain communication tech-stack. 

### About Us
TAU Cambridge(UK) is located in Cambridge Science Park and registered in United Kingdom. The company is funded through private venture capitals without conducting any **ICO** or selling coins to public. TAU will airdrop 82% of TAUcoins to world communities and keep 12% for development of the technology.
