### Introduction
#### TAU - the free community coin app.
TAU Cambridge provides a free community coin mobile app with no need for servers. Without paying any third party transaction cost, such as eth or bnb, personal devices could build, mine and transact blockchain coins independently. 

* Our product for end user is an open source app: it enables phones to form up independent blockchains for ditigal coins circulation, so that communities can freely operate payment and communication. We emphasize on saving data consumption and tailor it to be useful in expensive and slow data region.
* We provide free and open source libTAU for developers to use our tech stack to build decentralized application without server deployments. 
* Users do not need to own any TAUcoins to build blockchains and make server-less communications. 

### libTAU
A open source c++ library for server-less p2p and blockchain communication with Java Swig and Shell interface. libTAU is forked out of libtorrent by answering following key problems, which were unsolvable in the pre-blockchain world. 
* Incentive to provide data, bandwidth and cpu power for peers
* Avoid Internet router protocol screening
* Pre-arranged bootstrap and time server 
<br> <br>

We also address server based blockchain problems. 
* Secret chain attack in the POS world
* Ledger data supply incentive
* Stateful to stateless transition for a flat state storage
* One phone mines 100 parallel independent blockchains

### About the core technology
TAU discovered the Perishable Proof of Transactions(PPOT) blockchain concensus, the more transactions made, the higher mining power it is. Without intensive puzzel solving competition, PPOT is a light weight blockchain consensus. The **perishable** ledger will forget any blocks 6 months older, to make full node size under 50M. Unlike immutable blockchain such as ethereum and bitcoin designed for long term financial contracts, PPOT is for day to day application communication on decentralized blockchain. <br><br>
One average smart phone mines 100+ full blockchains, based on libTAU server-less blockchain communication tech-stack. 

### About Us
TAU Cambridge(UK) is located in Cambridge Science Park and registered in United Kingdom. The company is funded through private venture capitals without conducting any **ICO** or selling coins to public. TAU will airdrop 82% of TAUcoins to world communities and keep 12% for development of the technology.
