### Introduction
TAU Cambridge is creating a Phone Crypto Mining(PCM trade-mark) technology. Without permitted or assisted by servers, personal devices will be able to build, mine and transact on blockchains independently.

When phones can communicate to each other for free and be incentivated to make blockchain consensus, without central servers, it reduces IT cost of operating a network application and removes major part of middleman charge. It will as well allow transparent and permission-less inter-application data exchange. 

### libTAU
A open source c++ library for server-less p2p and blockchain communication with Java Swig and Shell interface. libTAU is forked out of libtorrent by answering following key problems, which were unsolvable in the pre-blockchain world. 
* Incentive to provide data, bandwidth and cpu power for peers
* Avoid Internet router protocol screening
* Pre-arranged bootstrap and time server 
<br> <br>
We also address server based blockchain problems. 
* Secret chain attack in the POS world
* Ledge data supply incentive
* Blockchain merging after regional network isolation

### About the core technology
TAU invented the Proof of Transaction(POT) blockchain concensus, the more transactions made, the higher mining power it is. Without intensive puzzel solving competition, POT is a light weight blockchain consensus. One average smart phone mines 100+ full blockchains, based on libTAU server-less blockchain communication tech-stack. 

### About Us
TAU Cambridge(UK) is located in Cambridge Science Park and registered in United Kingdom. The company is funded through private venture capitals without conducting any **ICO** or selling coins to public. TAU will airdrop 82% of TAUcoins to world communities and keep 12% for development of the technology.
* Our product for consumer is the Phone Crypto Mining open source app: it enables phones to form up independent blockchains for ditigal coins circulation, so that communities can freely operate payment and communication. We emphasize on saving data consumption and tailor it to be useful in expensive and slow data region.
* We provide free and open source libTAU for developers. 
* Users do not need to own any TAUcoins to build blockchains and make server-less communications.
