### Introduction
#### TAU Mobile App - Create coins and trade community for free.
TAU aims to help you to create P2P crypto trade community without tie to servers. 

You create own coins econemy independantly from other chains, so to be avoid of third party transaction fee. We emphasize on saving mobile data, so that P2P trade can operate everywhere. We do not require user to own any TAUcoins for enjoying the functions. Community can airdrop coins to participants freely. 

We want to help individuals to build trade community and increase value of community coins. Therefore, TAU Cambridge makes the blockchain system working on smart phones with very low data consumption, which is important for developing regions such as Africa.

### About the core technologies
#### Perishable Proof of Transactions(PPOT) Blockchain Consensus

TAU discovered the PPOT blockchain concensus, the more transactions made, the higher mining power it is. Without intensive puzzel solving competition, PPOT is a light weight blockchain consensus. 

The **perishable** ledger will forget any block and state 6 months older, to make full node size under 50M. Unlike immutable blockchain such as ethereum and bitcoin designed for long term financial contracts, PPOT is light for day to day application on decentralized blockchain. PPOT blocks are designed to register user and help them to communicate messages. 

One individual smart phone can hold and mine 100+ full blockchains. Collectively, the parallelism brings to the network unlimted transaction capacity. 
TAU Cambridge provides an opensource C++ reference implementation of PPOT parallel mining and messaging on github(...libTAU).

#### IP2
Internet Protocol 2 uses self-generated 256 bits public key as address, while previous Internet Protocol[3] uses hierarchically assigned address ether IPv4 or IPv6 to communicate. IP2 is designed for restriction free "public key to public key" overlay communication on UPD. IP2 is not easily affacted by network devices such as router, firewall and NAT.

The technology stack includes "distributed routing vectors" for traversing, sending and capturing data, and ED25519 assymetric encryption for premission-less and colision-free unique addressing and pattern randomized transmission on UDP. TAU Cambridge provides an opensource C++ reference implementation libIP2 on github(...libIP2).
PPOT blockchain consensus is an application of IP2.
