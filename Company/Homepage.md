### Introduction
#### TAU Mobile App - Create coins and trade community for free.
TAU helps you to create P2P crypto trade community without link to servers. 

You can create own coins independantly from other blockchain avoid of third party transaction fee. We do not require user to own any TAUcoins for enjoying the functions, so that community leaders can airdrop coins to participants freely. 

We want to help individuals to build trade community and increase value of community coins everywhere; therefore TAU makes the blockchain system working on smart phones with very low data consumption, which is important for developing regions such as Africa.

### About the core technologies
#### Perishable Proof of Transactions(PPOT) Blockchain Consensus

TAU discovered the PPOT blockchain concensus, the more transactions made, the higher mining power it is. Without intensive puzzel solving competition, PPOT is a light weight blockchain consensus. 

The **perishable** ledger will forget any block and state 6 months older, to make full node size under 50M. Unlike immutable blockchain such as ethereum and bitcoin designed for long term financial contracts, PPOT is light for day to day application on decentralized blockchain. PPOT blocks are designed to register user and help them to communicate messages. 

PPOT makes one individual smart phone to hold and mine 100+ full blockchains. Collectively, the parallelism brings to the network unlimted transaction capacity. 
TAU Cambridge provides an opensource C++ reference implementation of PPOT parallel mining and messaging on github(...libTAU).

#### Internet Protocol 2 - IP2

Internet Protocol 2(IP2) enables user to choose self-generated 256-bits "public key" as address, while classical Internet Protocol(IP1) appoints hierarchically and often dynamically addresses. IP1 has caused "uncertain device reachability" in types of address and connection, especially when same device is moving through different networks or locating in unknown changing firewall rules; therefore additional proxy or name server infrastructure burden is needed for each application.

IP2 is designed for "public key direct to public key" overlay communication. Thanks to the innovation of XOR distance to form up the local capture swarm network, the nodes are incentivated to share "public key to IP address" naming and relaying for restricted nodes, disregard of application types.

On top of IP2, traditional TCP or UDP type of services could be rebuilt without worrying about static/dynamic, v4/v6, local/public, wifi/cellular types of IP1 addresses and their fluid firewall/NAT restrictions. This potentially reduces cost of operating IOT devices, as well.

The technology stack includes "distributed routing vectors" for sending and capturing data, ED25519 assymetric encryption for premission-less and colision-free unique addressing, and pattern randomized transmission on UDP. TAU Cambridge provides an opensource C++ reference implementation libIP2 on github(...).

PPOT blockchain consensus is an application of IP2. 

### About Us
TAU Cambridge(UK) is located in Cambridge Science Park and registered in United Kingdom. The company is funded through private venture capitals without conducting any **ICO** or selling coins to public. TAU will airdrop 80% of TAUcoins to world community leaders. TAUCoin(TM) is a registerred trademark in UK.
