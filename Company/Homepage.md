Introduction
TAU Cambridge is creating a Phone Crypto Mining(PCM trade-mark) technology. Without permitted or assisted by servers, personal devices will be able to build, mine and transact on blockchains independently.

When phones can communicate to each other for free and be incentivated to make blockchain consensus, without central servers, it reduces IT cost of operating a network application and removes major part of middleman charge. It will as well create transparent and free inter-application exchange. 

libTAU
A open source c++ library for server-less p2p and blockchain communication with Java Swig and Shell interface. libTAU is forked out of libtorrent by solving following key problems, which was unsolvable in the pre-blockchain world. 
* incentive to provide data, bandwidth and cpu power
* avoid Internet router blockage
* centralised bootstrap and time server


About the core technology
TAU invented the Proof of Transaction(POT) blockchain concensus, the more transactions made, the higher mining power it is. Without intensive puzzel solving competition, POT is a light blockchain consensus. An average smart phone mines 100+ full blockchains based on libTAU server-less blockchain communication tech-stack. 

About Us
TAU Cambridge(UK) is located in Cambridge Science Park and registered in United Kingdom. We are funded through private venture capitals without conducting any ICO. 
Our product is the Phone Crypto Mining App: it enables phones to form up independent blockchains for ditigal coins circulation, so that communities can freely operate payment and communication. We pay particular attention to save data consumption and tailor it to be useful in expensive and slow data region.
