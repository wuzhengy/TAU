### TAU - pay and sell digital coins
Anna’s dream is to make and sell garlic paste in Accra. She needs money to buy the raw materials. Anna is surrounded by customers that like her products. She has one android phone and want to process payment and raise money.

TAU is a free app that can enable Anna to generate digital coins, which she can exchange with customers in return for Ghanaian Cedis cash. The coins can then be used by buyers to pay for the garlic paste at a lower price.

As the business grows, the value of the coins increase against the Cedis, because of the quantity of coins is limitted while cash always depreciating. It’s a ‘win-win’ for Anna and customers. TAU is built on advanced blockchain technology to provide secure transactions and messaging.
