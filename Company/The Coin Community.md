### TAU - The Coin Community
Anna, a lovely Ghana village lady, dreams to start a shop to serve delicious garlic paste. She does not have 500 dollars of Cedis to buy garlic and oil, while friends and neighbours know that Anna will make good paste with heart. <br>
TAU provides a pure free phone app for Anna to raise money, chat with community and promote products. Without computer expertise, Ann will use TAU to make 10 thousands blockchain coins and exchange some coins for initial Cedis to buy ingredients. Customers can use Anna's blockchain coins to buy garlic paste with nice discount. <br>
Anna got 500 dollars with no interest, and customers get garlic paste on nice price and hold coins for future use. No one pays expensive IT service fee forever. Everyone happy. <br>
To achieve these, TAU engineers combine the world most advanced blockchain, torrent and mobile technologies to create a 100% open-source software to make following technology advancements:<br>
* server-less: no money required to operate the community forever
* blockchain coins circulation: non-inflation, transparent and immutable
* supporting global millions of shops without IT investment
