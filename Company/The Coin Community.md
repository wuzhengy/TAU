### TAU - The Coin Community
Anna, a lovely Ghana village lady, wants to start a shop to serve garlic paste. She does not have 500 dollars of Cedi to buy garlic and oil, while her friends and neighbours know that Anna will make good paste with heart. <br>
TAU provides a pure free phone app for Anna to raise money, chat with community and promote products. Without computer expertise, Ann will use TAU to make 10 thousands blockchain coins and exchange some coins for initial Cedi to buy ingredients. Customers can use Anna's coins to buy garlic paste with nice discount. <br>
Anna got 500 dollars with no interest, and customers get garlic paste at nice price and hold coins for future use. No one pays expensive IT service fee forever. Everyone happy. <br>
To achieve these, TAU engineers combined the world most advanced blockchain, torrent and mobile technologies to create a 100% open-source software to make following technology advancements:<br>
* server-less: no money needed to operate forever
* blockchain coins circulation: non-inflation, transparent and immutable
* supports global millions of shops without IT investment
