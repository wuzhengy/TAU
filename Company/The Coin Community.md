### TAU - The Coin Community
Anna, a lovely Ghana village lady, wants to start a shop to serve garlic paste. She does not have 500 dollars worth of Ghana Cedi to buy garlic, flour and oil, while her friends and neighbours knows that Anna will make good paste with heart. 
TAU provides a pure free phone app for Anna to raise money, build chat community and product advertisement. With no computer expertise, Ann will use TAU to make 10 Thousands blockchain coins and sell some coins for initial Cedi to buy ingredients. Customers can use coins to buy Anna products with nice discount. 
Anna got 500 dollars interests free, and customers get garlic paste at nice price and holds coins for future use. No one pays expensive IT service fee forever. Everyone happy. 
To achieve all this, TAU engineers combined the most advanced blockchain, torrent and mobile technologies to create a 100% open-source software to make following features:
* server-less: no money needed to operate forever
* blockchain coins circulation: non-inflation, transparent and immutable
