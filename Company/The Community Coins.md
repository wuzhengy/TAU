### TAU - The Community Coins
#### Helping individual finance business ideas
Anna’s dream is to set up a shop to produce and sell garlic paste. Like many women in Ghana, she is struggling to raise finance to buy the raw materials. She is surrounded by a community that could support her, but needs a way to raise enough money to produce the garlic paste.

TAU is a free phone app that can enable Anna to generate blockchain coins, which she can then exchange with her community in return for Ghanaian Cedis, so she is able to buy raw materials and produce the paste. The coins can then be used by this community to buy the garlic paste from Anna at a competitive price.

As the community grows and the volume of transactions increases, the value of the coins increase against the Cedis. It’s a ‘win-win’ for Anna and her customers.

### About the technology

TAU is combining the world’s most advanced blockchain, torrent and mobile technologies to create 100% open source software, in particular:

Sever-less: no hosting is needed, everything is on the phone’s swarm network;
Blockchain coins are not affected by inflation, are transparent and immutable; and
Supporting a global community of underprivileged people with free access.
